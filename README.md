This was a week-long project for the data visualization course at FU Berlin.

My goal was to collaborate with a think tank to conduct a case study using the Global Therrorist dataset.

My objectives were:
  1. Create a modern responsive 3D UI with proper data visualization.
  2. Provide a modern UX in terms of microinteractions and transitions.
  3. Make animations and 3D work effectively across all browsers.
  
 
P.S. If you're opening the final presentation on a mobile device, use landscape mode because its responsiveness was out of scope of this project. Sometimes there are problems with Threejs on mobile devices and some of the auxilary 3D components don't work (e.g. the Earth on the landing page).
